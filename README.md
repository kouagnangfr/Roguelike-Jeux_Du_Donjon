# Roguelike-Jeux_Du_Donjon
The "Roguelike" genre is a type of game in which "the player explores a dungeon infested with monsters which he must fight to gain experience and treasures" [Wikipedia]. When the player fails, he loses his progress and must start from the beginning. Like several popular games such as The Binding of Isaac.
